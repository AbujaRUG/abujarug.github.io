Join our study group focused on leveraging R for Geospatial Analysis. Explore the integration of spatial data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling using R packages like sf, leaflet, and raster. Collaborate with fellow participants to tackle real-world geospatial challenges, from mapping to spatial analytics. Whether you're a beginner or experienced R user, this group offers a supportive environment to enhance your geospatial skills and apply them to diverse domains. Join us to unlock the potential of R for spatial exploration and problem-solving. The book for the group is [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/)
